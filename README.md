# A Collection of simple Javascript projects

Many of the projects were inspired by Chris Ferdinandi's [Vanilla JS Projects](https://vanillajsprojects.com/) projects. I implemented the JS myself on these.

Some of the other projects were from the amazing [Beginner Javascript](https://beginnerjavascript.com/) course by Wes Bos.

As I learn, I'll continue to add small JS projects here.
